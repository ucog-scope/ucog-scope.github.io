        <h2>Ukrainian Combat Optical Gunsight (UCOG) is a Fight For Ukraine and Yehor Shytikov Project. Fight For Ukraine LLC is the centralized, organized conduit for U.S. and select partner nation private-sector military assistance to Ukraine in its battle with Russia.
        </h2>
        <p>This project is U.S. private-sector response to date has been ad hoc and haphazard. UCOG and Fight For Ukraine team employs senior retired and former service members who know how to add focus, clarity, purpose, and organization to the private-sector effort to support Ukraine against a tyrannical foreign invader.
        </p>
        
        <p><b>“The fight is on — the need is now.”</b> – Mark Kilbane, CEO</p>

        <p>This is Project made possible because of individuals and businesses sharing our hope for peace in Ukraine.</p>
       
        <h3>The problem</h3>
        <p>Rifle scopes have been becoming popular in US army for the right reasons. Scopes on top of a service rifle provide bunch of benefits, some of which include the pleasure of getting higher accuracy, longer range, psychological and personal contentment, and the ability to fire shots from a good distance. The number of pros outweigh the number of cons and makes rifle scopes a must-have equipment for any soldier.</p>
        <p>The clock is ticking. 
          We designing and manafucturing optical gunsight for Ukraine, and they save lives. We also need to produce and deliver the AK-74 dovetail and Picatinny rail mounting kit, flashiders and silencers. 
        </p>
        </p>

        <p><b>SCOPES SAVE LIVES</b> — Ukrainin soldiers can shoot straighter from farther away!</p>
      <p>
         <h3>UCOG - Anti-Aircraft (AA)</h3>
<p>Russian terrorist army and especially private mercenaries terrorist group like “Wagner” pays great attention to the use of UAV drones, especially the cheap Chinese DJI Mavic 3. Drones are used both to identify targets and for command and control of the assault. Drones monitor the movement of assault groups and monitor the situation at the attack site. The headquarters of the assault detachment tries to have continuous information about the movement of combat groups and the situation at our position, which is chosen as the object of attack. That is, the assessment of the situation, and the need to move forward, is determined by the commander of the assault unit at the headquarters. Team – forward along the route, team – stop, spread out, we are waiting. For Russia, drone costs more than a hundred criminals. 
Conversely, Damage to drones means losing effective control of assault groups.</p>
 
<p>Our team founded MilTech startup to create anti-dron solutions. Ukrainian Combat Optical Gunsight - Anti-Aircraft (UCOG-AA) version is designed to fight any aircraft including large kamikaze drones of the terrorists like Iranian Shahed and Russian Kub/Zala, Cruise missiles, Helicopters and small drones like DJI. A big issue with small consumer drones is their small size. It is where x3 Magnifications get handy. Check the video and you will see the difference. A central part of the Scope (Chevron with BDC reticle) can be effectively used against ground criminals. Basically, it is a 2-in-1 peacemaking solution. </p>
 
<p>UCOG-AA scope is designed to help the shooter compensate for the altitude, range and airspeed of the target aircraft (UAV/Drone). It works much like the modern mil-dot reticle with each circle representing 10 m/s aircraft speed. A shooter like up the nose of an approaching airplane with the center of sight while keeping the aircraft's nose on the ring most appropriate with the speed and range of the aircraft. Such scope makes it easier to lead the target when shooting flying aircraft.  </p>

<h3> Ballistic Calculrator</h3>

 <p>
 This is a smart ballistic calculator for long-range and anti-aircraft shooting. 
 It helps shooters calculate lead correction and scope settings necessary for long-range shots. Supports AK and AR families rifles.
 Available for iPhone, iPad, iPod and Apple Watch.
 This calculator uses temperature, altitude, humidity, atmospheric pressure, distance to a target, target speed and direction, coriolis effect, and shooting angle for calculating optimal vertical, horizontal and lead corrections.

          <b> Why Ukrainian Guys also need titanium silencers:</b> 
          to reduce environmental noise,
reduce recoil,
eliminate the muzzle flash visible in the dark,
mask the location of the soldiers,
titanium silencers are lightweight and durable, full-auto rated. 
<br>
  So, our guys can make more precise shots until spoted. Enemy can't hear silenced shooting noise at 200 meter. Our Optic and Silencer is a good combination. 
          </p>
      <h2> Smart Electronic Gunsight</h2>
      <p>
       Smart electronic sight IOT attachments for aiming Heavy Machine Guns like M2 Browning with tripods, Mortairs, Artillery and other security instruments using ballistic data with the communication with a tactical tablet mobile App (Android, iOS) via Bluetooth 5.0 or PC via USB type-C.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        eUCOG finds the magnetic north and any aiming direction in seconds. The system is easily fixed to the instruments through a dovetail, picatinny rail wiht Ammerican Defence Quick Detach(QD), barrel clamp-ons. The size and weight of the system is smaller than the traditional sight units. Can be combined with the traditional sight as an anditional tool. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The aiming data can be entered into the system manually and automatically from a fire control system "Kropiva" or other.
        <b>"Kropiva"</b> is Ukrainian combat control system for calculating artillery and combat control. 
     </p>
      <img width="100%" src="/img/ahtbw71fh55a1.jpg">
     <p>
        eUCOG aiming is not dependent on visibility conditions. It can be aimed regardless of fog, rain, night, dust, forest, or any other aiming reference limitations.
      </p>
      <p>
       The user easily adjusts the bipod hand-cranks looking at a graphical scheme. In few seconds, the instrument is ready to fire. The after-firing adjustment is obtained extremely fast, because with eUCOG is ready to fire accurately in under 5 seconds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sight can have a backup red dot for for aiming visible targets during the day and night and has laser range finder capabilities.
